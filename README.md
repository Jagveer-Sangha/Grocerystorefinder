# Grocery Store Finder

Grocery store finder is an application created for the 2021 Bitcamp hackathon. The web application asks the user to input their location onto the webpage and it will find the closest grocery store in the area and put a roadmap to that store.

# What's next for Grocery Store Finder
For our web application, we will continue to develop it, adding in new features such as finding the shortest path to the nearest grocery store, determine which grocery store is the safest based on covid-19 hot spots in your local area, along with an overhaul in the UI/UX design to improve our users experience. Overall, these features will allow the website to reach more users and help people find the best grocery stores in their area.
